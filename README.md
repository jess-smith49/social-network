The application is the backend for a social network API. It allows a user to enter a username and email, add thoughts, friends, and reactions.

## Technologies
The technologies used in this social-network API are MongoDB/Mongoose, Express.js, Node.js and JavaScript. This was created using VSCode and testing the routes in Insomnia core.

## Future Development

The future development for this would be to create a front-end so that users can interact with this application. They would be able to create an account, add their own thoughts and reactions, and add friends. Users would also be able to see other users thoughts.
