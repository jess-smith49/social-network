# Social-Network API

## Description
The application is the backend for a social network API. It allows a user to enter a username and email, add thoughts, friends, and reactions.

## Usage
This application is used as a social network. It is intended for users to be able to interact with and add/delete friends, reactions, and thoughts.

## Technologies
The technologies used in this social-network API are MongoDB/Mongoose, Express.js, Node.js and JavaScript. This was created using VSCode and testing the routes in Insomnia core.

## Future Development
The future development for this would be to create a front-end so that users can interact with this application. They would be able to create an account, add their own thoughts and reactions, and add friends. Users would also be able to see other users thoughts. Users will also be able to delete friends and reactions with the front-end. I would also like to use SASS or another front-end package to design this.
